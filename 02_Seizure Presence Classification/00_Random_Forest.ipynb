    "## 7. Conclusion\n",
    "The goal of this notebook was to demonstrate a binary classification of time series EEG data for epileptic seizure detection by using a Random Forest classifier. To begin, the preprocessed dataset was loaded, the feature dimension was flattened and split into a training and validation subset. In order to build the best possible classification model, hyperparameter optimization was performed and the optimization space was defined first for this purpose. The optimization was performed using the Hyperopt library, which is based on Bayesian mathematics. The objective function includes the definition, training and evaluation of the random forest classifier. In addition, a 5-fold cross validation was performed. The used hyperparameters as well as the results are passed to the minimization function and stored there. After the successful optimization, the hyperparameters with the best result were extracted and an optimized random forest classifier was created. This was also trained and validated with the help of not yet used validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the approach using a random forest classifier has proven to be usable. However, the model only achieved an F1 score of 0.83, which limits its real-world applicability. A final comparison of all methodologies will be made in Notebok `04_Model Comparison.ipynb`."
